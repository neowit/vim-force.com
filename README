DESCRIPTION                                             *force.com-description*

force.com plugin is a bunch of .vim scripts which allow to develop on force.com 
platform using only web browser and Vim

It is designed for those who do not feel productive in Force.com IDE for Eclipse

                                                       *force.com-installation*

Installation/System requirements 

Before force.com plugin can be used following requirements must be met:

1. Vim version 7.3 or later with :set nocompatible
	There is a chance that it will work with 7.2 as well, but I have not tested

2. Java JDK/JRE, Version 6.1 or greater
   tested with OpenJDK and Oracle JDK
   - java version "1.6.0_18" OpenJDK Runtime Environment (IcedTea6 1.8.10)
   - Oracle JDK
     http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

   JDK is not strictly required, JRE will suffice.
   With JRE Ant will complain about missing tools.jar but it is safe to ignore this warning


3. Apache ANT 
   tested with Apache Ant(TM) 
   - version 1.8.2 on Win XP SP3
   - version 1.8.0 on Linux

4. Force.com Migration Tool  
	Tested with salesforce_ant_19.0

    Download it as described here:
    http://wiki.developerforce.com/page/Force.com_Migration_Tool#How_to_Install

    ant-salesforce.jar library must be made available to ANT

    The order in which jars are added to the classpath is as follows:

    * -lib jars in the order specified by the -lib elements on the command line
    * jars from ${user.home}/.ant/lib (unless -nouserlib is set)
    * jars from ANT_HOME/lib

    see http://ant.apache.org/manual/running.html#libs for more details
    as well as
    http://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/apexcode/Content/apex_deploying_ant.htm

5. On MS Windows Install shortname.vim 
    http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=433

6. Unpack force.com plugin archive anywhere you like

ex: ~/vim/force.com

7. Add 'force.com' folder to vim runtime path and make sure it loads apexcode filetype detection

e.g.
	if has("unix")
		let &runtimepath=&runtimepath . ',~/vim/force.com'
	elseif has("win32")
		let &runtimepath=&runtimepath . ',c:\Documents and Settings\username\vimfiles\force.com'
	endif
	" make sure vim loads apexcode filetype detection
	runtime ftdetect/apexcode.vim

8. Enable filetype plugin and syntax highlighting

e.g. add these lines into .vimrc (or _vimrc on windows)
	filetype plugin on
	syntax on

8. Index help file

e.g.
    :helptags ~/vim/force.com/doc

    Or if using with pathogen.vim plugin and force.com is in .vim/bundle run
    :Helptags

USAGE                                                         *force.com-usage*

There are two ways to use force.com plugin
A.|apex-with-eclipse|                       Alongside Force.com IDE for Eclipse
B.|apex-plugin-standalone|                  Standalone, without Eclipse

Both methods assume that there is a <project-name>.properties file available
at the location specified by |'g:apex_properties_folder'|
See salesforce_migration_guide.pdf (http://wiki.developerforce.com/page/Migration_Tool_Guide) 
for details of .properties file.
Before moving next make sure to configure all global variables listed in |force.com-settings|

Project Setup and Structure                                *apex-project-setup*

	vim force.com plugin uses same project structure as Force.com IDE for Eclipse
		<eclipse project folder>
		--./src
		----./classes
		----./pages
		----./triggers
		----...

	So if you have existing eclipse project then you can start using force.com plugin
	straight away by opening .class or .trigger file with vim
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A. Using alongside Force.com IDE for Eclipse                *apex-with-eclipse* 


	1. Create Force.com project with Eclipse as usual (selecting necessary metadata types)
	2. [optional] close Eclipse
	3. switch back to file system
	4. go to eclipse Eclipse workspace and locate folder of your project
	5. open any source class (.cls) file with vim
	
	at this point if class code is syntax highlighted then chances are that most of your 
	config is right
	
	6. issue command 
	   :ApexRefreshProject

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
B. vim force.com plugin standalone                     *apex-plugin-standalone*

In this mode Eclipse is not needed

 B.1. Creating new project
	- inside force.com plugin folder locate folder A-ProjectTemplate
	- copy A-ProjectTemplate to the location where you want your project
	  to reside and rename as desired, 
	  ex: '/home/user/projects/My Org (Sandbox)'
	- inside 'src/classes' folder locate A-Fake-Class.cls and open with Vim
	- Issue command:  
	  :ApexRefreshProject

 B.2. Adding Class/Page/Trigger
	- create relevant apex Class/Page/Trigger via force.com UI (Setup->Develop)
	- Run command
	  :ApexRefreshProject

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Plugin exposes following commands:                              *apex-commands*

|ApexCompare|                       compare two projects
|ApexCompareWithPreRefreshVersion|  compare with pre refresh project state
|ApexDeploy|                        deploy project to SFDC
|ApexDeployConfirm|                 deploy with confirmation for each file
|ApexDeployOpen|                    deploy all open files
|ApexGitInit|                       initialise new Git repository for current 
                                    project
|ApexPrintChanged|                  display all modified files
|ApexRefreshFile|                   refresh current file from SFDC
|ApexRefreshProject|                refresh project from SFDC

|ApexTListToggle|                   toggle taglist (works if 'taglist' plugin 
                                    is installed)

                                                                  *ApexCompare*
Imagine you have 2 sandboxes of the same Org and want to compare current file
with its counterpart in another sandbox

Example:
Assume following salesforce project folder structure
    .../some-path/sandbox 1/src
    .../some-path/prod org/src
'some-path' may be root of eclipse workspace or any other folder

':ApexCompare' will open durrectory selection dialogue
Assuming current project is 'sandbox 1' select 'prod org' folder and system will 
open specified (|'g:apex_diff_cmd'|) diff tool with both files 



                                             *ApexCompareWithPreRefreshVersion*
Every time before refresh from SFDC is executed system backs up modified files
from current project in the location specified by |'g:apex_backup_folder'|
Once refresh is complete it is possible to quickly open diff tool to compare
current file with its pre-refresh version.
Same as with |ApexCompare| you only have to pick top level folder of the relevant backup
i.e. parent of ./src/ folder, no need to drill down into project subfolders

                                                            *ApexDeploy*
Use :|ApexDeploy| to upload/deploy/save all modified files of current project
to SFDC
                                                            *force.com-F11*
Plugin also defines keyboard shortcut F11 which calls :ApexDeploy and works
in 'normal' and 'insert' modes

                                                            *ApexDeployConfirm*
As opposite to |ApexDeploy| with |ApexDeployConfirm| system will ask for confirmation
to deploy every modified file to SFDC

                                                            *ApexDeployOpen*
Deploy/Save to SFDC all files open in current vim instance

                                                            *ApexGitInit*
If git is available then :ApexGitInit can be used to initialise new git
repository in current force.com project and add (with confirmation) existing
source files
See apexUtil#gitInit() for the list of supported force.com project resources

                                                            
                                                            *ApexPrintChanged*
Display changed files, i.e. candidates for deployment to SFDC

                                                            
                                                            *ApexRefreshFile*
Refresh current (single) file and replace it with its version from SFDC

                                                            *ApexRefreshProject*
Refresh current project and download new/modified files from SFDC replacing
all local files

                                                            *ApexTListToggle*
Helper for 'Tagist' plugin (http://vim-taglist.sourceforge.ne)
Taglist plugin does not support mixed filetypes like: apexcode.java 
so we have to trick it like if &filetype was = 'apexcode'
i.e. every time when Taglist is called set filetype=apexcode temporarely
and then revert back to what it was 
See apexcode.vim s:Apex_TList_Toggle() method for more details



==============================================================================
SETTINGS                                                   *force.com-settings*

Before using force.com plgin following variables must be defined (ex: in .vimrc)
The plugin provides the following options that can customise the behaviour the
force.com plugin behaviour. These options should be set in your vimrc.

All of the examples below are for Unix environments. When defining paths for MS Windows 
use double slash, like this:
let g:apex_backup_folder="c:\\temp\\apex\\backup"


Required
|'g:apex_backup_folder'|          project backup folder
|'g:apex_temp_folder'|            temporary folder
|'g:apex_deployment_error_log'|   temporary error file
|'g:apex_properties_folder'|      login/pass/token credentials

Required MS Windows only
|'g:apex_binary_tee'|             full path to tee.exe executable
|'g:apex_binary_touch'|           full path to touch.exe executable

Optional
|'g:apex_diff_cmd'|                 path to file comparison tool

|apex-config-example|               .vimrc config example

                                                        *'g:apex_backup_folder'*

/path/to/folder where current project source is backed up before refresh from SFDC
ex: 
	let g:apex_backup_folder="/tmp/apex/backup"

                                                          *'g:apex_temp_folder'*

Every time when ApexDeploy is called we copy files (to be fed to ANT job and deployed to sfdc) 
into /path/to/folder defined by g:apex_temp_folder
ex: 
	let g:apex_temp_folder="/tmp/apex/gvim-deployment"

                                                  *'g:apex_deployment_error_log'*	

ANT error log file name which is stored in "g:apex_temp_folder
ex:
	let g:apex_deployment_error_log="gvim-deployment-error.log"

                                                    *'g:apex_properties_folder'*	
Path to folder with *.property files which contain SFDC orgs access details
It is recommended to store those files in encrypted folder or partition.
Note, full path is required.
If path is incorrect then you will get error looking something like this:
	BUILD FAILED
	/.../build.xml:57: Failed to login: Failed to send request to https://${dest.sf.serverurl}/services/Soap/u/...

Example below assumes that we are using Truecrypt

ex:
	let g:apex_properties_folder="/media/truecrypt1"

or for win32, assuming that Truecrypt volume is T:
	let g:apex_properties_folder="t:"

                                                          *force.com-unix_utils*
Plugin is using unix utilities 'tee' and 'touch'
On MS Windows these commands are not available out of the box.
UnixUtils for Win32 can be found here: http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/

See |'g:apex_binary_tee'| and |'g:apex_binary_touch'|
On Unix setting these variables is not strictly necessary, unless 'tee' and 'touch'
are not available via $PATH

Plugin also uses other built in shell commands like
'rm', 'mkdir', 'cp' on unix
and
'rmdir', 'copy' on ms windows
But it is assumed that these are generally available out of the box.
If you are using non standard environment then you can define paths to those commands.
See apexOs.vim for details

                                                            *'g:apex_binary_tee'*
Full path to shell command 'tee'
tee - read from standard input and write to standard output and files

ex:
	let g:apex_binary_tee = "/usr/bin/tee"
or for win32
	let g:apex_binary_tee = "d:\\bin\\UnixUtils\\tee.exe"

                                                            *'g:apex_binary_touch'*
Full path to shell command 'touch'
tee - read from standard input and write to standard output and files

ex:
	let g:apex_binary_touch = "/usr/bin/touch"
or for win32
	let g:apex_binary_touch = "d:\\bin\\UnixUtils\\touch.exe"

                                                             *'g:apex_diff_cmd'*
/path/to/file/compare/tool
ex:
	let g:apex_diff_cmd="/usr/bin/meld"

If undefined then internal vimdiff will be used

                                                        *apex-config-example*

LIMITATIONS                                             *force.com-limitations*

vim force.com plugin does not support creating force.com project or files within
project. Use SFDC web interface to create new class/trigger/page... and then issue
:ApexRefreshProject
to pull new files down to local drive

ant-salesforce.jar library does not report error line numbers in Visualforce pages
making it impossible to go-to actual problem line if compile/save fails due to syntax
error. This is similar to Force.com IDE for Eclipse.

Current version does not support environment aware code completion
For example if you write

	String val = 'abc';
typing 
	val.
will not bring the list of String methods as Force.com IDE may do

"Execute Anonymous" and "Run test" features are not implemented. Use your favourite 
web browser in the meantime.

On MS Windows default configuration spawns separate DOS/CMD window on every call
to command line utility, ex: ant deploy
It looks like there is a way to overcome this but I have not tried it
@see shell.vim - http://peterodding.com/code/vim/shell/

Credit must go out to Bram Moolenaar and all the Vim developers for
making the world's best editor (IMHO). I also want to thank everyone who
helped and gave me suggestions. I wouldn't want to leave anyone out so I
won't list names.
