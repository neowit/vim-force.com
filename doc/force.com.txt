DESCRIPTION                                             *force.com-description*

vim-force.com plugin is a bunch of .vim scripts which allow to develop on
force.com platform using only web browser and Vim

It is designed for those who do not feel productive in Force.com IDE for Eclipse

                                                *force.com-system-requirements* 
                                                       *force.com-installation*

Installation/System requirements 

Note 1: vim config folder location
in some examples below you may notice ~/vim instead of ~/.vim, 
if you are using ~/.vim then make sure to adjust paths according to your config

Note 2: it is recommended to use absolute paths in your config to avoid problems

Before vim-force.com plugin can be used following requirements must be met:

1. Vim version 7.3 or later with :set nocompatible

2. Java JDK/JRE, Version 7 or greater
   - Oracle JDK
     http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

   JDK is not strictly required, JRE will suffice.

3. tooling-force.com.jar
   See releases page here: https://github.com/neowit/tooling-force.com

4. On MS Windows 
	Make sure that all paths in your configuration are as short as possible.
	vim-force.com will be calling tooling-force.com.jar and passing many
	parameters via command line and some MS Window version struggle with long
	command lines. 
	Consider installing python and configuring your vim with |+python|
	support, this will help to remove annoying CMD/DOS popups on every
	operation. See also |vim-python-ms-windows|
	If you do not want to go with python then consider vimproc, see
	|force.com-limitations|

5. Unpack vim-force.com plugin archive anywhere you like

ex: ~/vim/vim-force.com

6. Enable filetype plugin and syntax highlighting

e.g. add these lines into .vimrc (or _vimrc on windows) >
	set nocompatible 
	filetype plugin on
	syntax on

7. If not using pathogen - below lines added on step 6, add 'vim-force.com'
   folder to vim runtime path and make sure it loads apexcode filetype detection

e.g. >
	if has("unix")
		let &runtimepath=&runtimepath . ',~/vim/vim-force.com'
	elseif has("win32")
		let &runtimepath=&runtimepath . ',c:\Documents and Settings\username\vimfiles\vim-force.com'
	endif
	" make sure vim loads apexcode filetype detection
	runtime ftdetect/vim-force.com.vim
<

	Alternatively, if using pathogen - drop 'vim-force.com' folder into
	~/.vim/bundle folder as usual.

8. Index help file

e.g. >
    :helptags ~/vim/vim-force.com/doc

<    Or if using with pathogen.vim plugin and vim-force.com is in ~/.vim/bundle run >
    :Helptags
<

9. Configure required variables: :help |force.com-settings|


10. Have a look at the config example: :help |force.com-config-example|


==============================================================================

	let g:apex_tooling_force_dot_com_path = "c:\\temp\\apex\\toolling-force.com.jar"
 	if !exists("g:apex_backup_folder")
 		" full path required here, relative may not work
 		let g:apex_backup_folder="c:\\temp\\apex\\backup"

 	let g:apex_binary_tee = "c:\\bin\\UnixUtils\\tee.exe"
 	let g:apex_binary_touch = "c:\\bin\\UnixUtils\\touch.exe"
 endif	

 set autowrite " not strictly required, but without it you will be getting
               " errors when running commands that open new buffer 
			   " (e.g. :ApexQuery or :ApexExecuteAnonymous) on unsaved file

 " (optional) if you want to enable server mode, uncoment 2 lines below

USAGE                                                         *force.com-usage*

There are two ways to use force.com plugin
A.|apex-with-eclipse|                       Alongside Force.com IDE for Eclipse
B.|apex-plugin-standalone|                  Standalone, without Eclipse

Both methods assume that there is a <project-name>.properties file available
at the location specified by |'g:apex_properties_folder'|
See salesforce_migration_guide.pdf or 
http://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/daas/index_Left.htm#StartTopic=Content/forcemigrationtool_connect.htm 
for details of .properties file.
Before moving next make sure to configure all global variables listed in |force.com-settings|

Project Setup and Structure                                *apex-project-setup*

	vim force.com plugin uses same project structure as Force.com IDE for Eclipse
		<eclipse project folder>
		--./src
		----./classes
		----./pages
		----./triggers
		----...

	So if you have existing eclipse project then you can start using force.com plugin
	straight away by opening .class or .trigger file with vim
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A. Using alongside Force.com IDE for Eclipse                *apex-with-eclipse* 


	1. Create Force.com project with Eclipse as usual (selecting necessary metadata types)
	2. [optional] close Eclipse
	3. switch back to file system
	4. go to eclipse Eclipse workspace and locate folder of your project
	5. open any source class (.cls) file with vim
	
	at this point if class code is syntax highlighted then chances are that most of your 
	config is right
	
	6. issue command 
	   :ApexRefreshProject

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
B. vim force.com plugin standalone                     *apex-plugin-standalone*

In this mode Eclipse is not needed.
Run :|ApexInitProject| and follow the wizard

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                                   *ApexCompare*

Imagine you have 2 sandboxes of the same Org and want to compare current file
with its counterpart in another sandbox

Example:
Assume following salesforce project folder structure
    .../some-path/sandbox 1/src
    .../some-path/prod org/src
'some-path' may be root of eclipse workspace or any other folder

':ApexCompare' will open directory selection dialogue
Assuming current project is 'sandbox 1' select 'prod org' folder and system
will open specified (|'g:apex_diff_cmd'|) diff tool with both files 

                                                      *ApexCompareLocalProjects*

Similar to :|ApexCompare| but instead of individual files this command calls
external diff tool on "src" folders of two projects.
Imagine you have 2 sandboxes of the same Org and want to compare current 
project with its counterpart in another sandbox file list wise.

Example:
Assume following salesforce project folder structure:
    .../some-path/sandbox 1/src
    .../some-path/prod org/src
'some-path' may be root of eclipse workspace or any other folder

':|ApexCompareLocalProjects|' will open directory selection dialogue.
Assuming current project is 'sandbox 1' select 'prod org' folder and system
will open specified (|'g:apex_diff_cmd'|) diff tool with "src" folders of both
projects.

                                              *ApexCompareWithPreRefreshVersion*

Every time when refresh from SFDC is executed system backs up modified files
from local project in the location specified by |'g:apex_backup_folder'|
Once refresh is complete it is possible to quickly open diff tool to compare
current file with its pre-refresh version.
Same as with |ApexCompare| you only have to pick top level folder of the
relevant backup i.e. parent of ./src/ folder, no need to drill down into
project subfolders.

                                                                    *ApexDeploy*

Use :|ApexDeploy| to deploy all modified files of current project to SFDC.
See also :|ApexPrintChanged|.

All commands in :|ApexDeploy|* family support 2 optional arguments 
- deployment mode: normal deploy or 'checkOnly'
- 'project name' to deploy to. This name should match file name part of
  .properties file which contains access details.
See |force.com-settings| for details about .properties files.
For example if I am working in "My Sandbox1" project and have 2 .properties 
files:
"My Sandbox 1.properties" and "My Sandbox 2.properties" then >
 :ApexDeploy
<will deploy by default using "My Sandbox 1.properties" file, while >
 :ApexDeploy My\ Sandbox\ 2
<will deploy files from current project using "My Sandbox 2.properties" file.

Project name argument of all commands in :|ApexDeploy|* family supports 
completion.
For instance, using project names from the example above >
 :ApexDeploy checkOnly My<Tab>
< will offer "My Sandbox 1" and "My Sandbox 2"

Note 1: Uses Metadata API.

Note 2: See also :|ApexSave|

Note 3: All commands in :|ApexDeploy|* family support <bang>, see 
|'g:apex_conflict_check'| for more details.

                                                                 *ApexDeployAll*

Deploy all files in current project. This feature works reasonably well with
code files, custom labels, page layouts and many other metadata types but
suffers from the same limitations as salesforce.com library for Ant. 
For example - it will not create new Profiles. If profile already exists, then it
will complain that it can not rename it, even if you are not trying to rename.
If there are Objects and Workflows in current project then SFDC may complain
that Objects have to be created before workflows, even if all objects already
exist in SFDC.

Note 1: Uses Metadata API.

Note 2: All commands in :|ApexDeploy|* family support <bang>, see 
|'g:apex_conflict_check'| for more details.

                                                      *ApexDeployAllDestructive*

*WARNING:*
This is a dangerous and destructive operation - use it at your peril!

In addition to behaving like :|ApexDeployAll|, it also removes files that live
remotely but that do not live locally. The files to which this applies to are
determined by your package.xml file.

It is wise to check :|ApexDiffWithRemoteProject| to see which files have changed,
and which files will be removed.

This command is useful when you are using version control systems like git and
treat them as your source of truth.

Note 1: Uses Metadata API.

Note 2: All commands in :|ApexDeploy|* family support <bang>, see 
|'g:apex_conflict_check'| for more details.

                                                         *ApexDeployDestructive*

*WARNING:* 
This is a dangerous and destructive operation - use it at your peril!

You can think of :ApexDeployDestructive as a combination of :|ApexDeploy| and
:|ApexRemoveStaged| executed in one go. 
Unlike :|ApexRemoveStaged| you do not have to add anything manually to the
Stage and the Stage is not used/touched.

In addition to deploying modified files there will be a check done to see if
local session contains information about local files that no longer exist on
the local machine. If such files are detected, they will be deleted from SFDC
as well.

It is always a good idea to run :|ApexPrintChanged| before
:|ApexDeployDestructive| to make sure that you know what files will be deleted in
"Destructive" part.

Example:
- create file MyClass.cls using :|ApexNewFile|
- run :ApexDeploy
  this will upload MyClass to SFDC and record MyClass.cls in the local session 
  store
- delete local file MyClass.cls & MyClass.cls-meta.xml from your drive
- run :ApexDeployDestructive
  this will deploy any modifications to existing files and also remove
  MyClass.cls from SFDC

Note 1: Uses Metadata API.

Note 2: All commands in :|ApexDeploy|* family support <bang>, see 
|'g:apex_conflict_check'| for more details.

                                                                *ApexDeployOpen*

Deploy to SFDC all files open in current Vim instance.

Note 1: Uses Metadata API.
Note 2: All commands in :|ApexDeploy|* family support <bang>, see 
|'g:apex_conflict_check'| for more details.

                                                                 *ApexDeployOne*

Deploy to SFDC single file from current buffer.

Note 1: Uses Metadata API.
Note 2: All commands in :|ApexDeploy|* family support <bang>, see 
|'g:apex_conflict_check'| for more details.

                                                              *ApexDeployStaged*

Deploy all files previously added by :|ApexStageAdd| command.

Note 1: Uses Metadata API.
Note 2: All commands in :|ApexDeploy|* family support <bang>, see 
|'g:apex_conflict_check'| for more details.

                                                        *ApexDiffWithRemoteFile*

Compare current file with its remote counterpart.
Params:
- [optional] - name of remote project (e.g. another sandbox)
  Name must match .properties file
  If provided then difference will be shown between current (local) project
  file and file in the specified remote Org.

                                                     *ApexDiffWithRemoteProject*

List file differences between local and remote project.
Params:
- [optional] - name of remote project (e.g. another sandbox)
  Name must match .properties file
  If provided then differences will be listed between current (local) project
  files and files in the specified remote Org.

                                                          *ApexExecuteAnonymous*

Execute a block of code.
Block can be either whole current buffer or visual selection

                                                    *ApexExecuteAnonymousRepeat*

A shortcut to repeat last :|ApexExecuteAnonymous| command.
Useful when you want to re-run visual selection which is not currently selected,
or you are not in the buffer where last :|ApexExecuteAnonymous| was run.

                                                                   *ApexGitInit*

If git is available then :|ApexGitInit| can be used to initialise new git
repository in current force.com project and add (with confirmation) existing
source files.

Supported resources types:
 -labels
 -pages
 -classes
 -triggers
 -components
 -static resources

                                                               *ApexInitProject*

Requires an existing SFDC org. To create one see: 
https://developer.salesforce.com

Asks project location/login related questions (see below) and creates a new
project folder and properties file.
As the very last step it will run :|ApexRefreshProject|.

Depending on whether or not |'g:apex_workspace_path'| variable is set the
project folder will be created in the current or relative to
|'g:apex_workspace_path'| directory, and the properties file in the path
specified by |g:apex_properties_folder|.

:|ApexRefreshProject| asks following questions:
1. Project name: Whatever string supported by the OS as a folder name.
2. Username: The SFDC org's user name (email format).
3. Password: The password for the given user name.
4. Security token: can be left blank if your IP is white-listed in the Org
   security settings.
5. Org type: It must be "login" for a dev/prod org or "test" for a sandbox.

Once project is setup you can proceed with creation of Class/Page/Trigger using
:|ApexNewFile|

                                                                       *ApexLog*

A shortcut to open (if available) log file generated by last Apex* command.

                                                                   *ApexNewFile*

Invoke file types menu and create Apex file (class, trigger, etc). 
Not all files are currently supported.

Note: File will be created with API version defined by |g:apex_API_version|
variable.

                                                              *ApexPrintChanged*

Display changed files, i.e. candidates for deployment to SFDC.

                                                            *ApexPrintConflicts*

Checks if locally modified files have been updated remotely since last time we
deployed local project.  
Takes into account only modified files (see :|ApexPrintChanged|), i.e. files
which would be deployed if :DeployModified command is executed.
See also |'g:apex_conflict_check'|.

                                                                     *ApexQuery*

Execute block of code as SOQL query.
Block can be either whole current buffer or visual selection.
Supports 2 (optional) parameters:
- API: Partner or Tooling
- project-name
Example >
    :ApexQuery Tooling MyOrg
<
                                                               *ApexQueryRepeat*

A shortcut to repeat last :|ApexQuery| command.
Useful when you want to re-run visual selection which is not currently selected,
or you are not in the buffer where last :|ApexQuery| was run.
Supports 2 (optional) parameters, see :|ApexQuery|

                                                               *ApexRefreshFile*

Refresh current (single) file and replace it with its version from SFDC.

Note: :|ApexRefreshFile| uses "diffWithRemote" in the background and only 
updates selected local file but does not touch local timestamp cache, hence 
during saving / deploying file to SFDC file still will be considered as 
outdated.

                                                            *ApexRefreshProject*

Refresh current project and download new/modified files from SFDC replacing
all local files.

                                                              *ApexRemoveStaged*

Delete staged files from current or specified Org. See |ApexStageAdd|.
Example 1: >
	:ApexRemoveStaged
< will remove all files listed in :ApexStage from the current Org
Example 2: >
	:ApexRemoveStaged My Other Org
< will remove staged files from "My Other Org"

                                                                  *ApexRetrieve*

Invoke metadata types list "menu" and load data of specified types.  
Usually :|ApexRefreshProject| will retrieve all types defined in package.xml.
:|ApexRetrieve| can be used to load types which are not part of current
package.xml Use this command when package.xml does not yet contain necessary
metadata type(s). If retrieved type is not part of the package.xml system will
offer to update package.xml accordingly. 
*WARNING* :|ApexRetrieve| command is Experimental. You may want to backup your
project before running :|ApexRetrieve|.

There are 2 potential scenarios which may involve :|ApexRetrieve|
1. Load all members of given metadata type
   e.g. to load all Custom Objects you will do something like this >
	:ApexRetrieve
< then select CustomObjects line and then run >
	:Retrieve
<
2. Load selected members of given metadata type
   e.g. to load only Account metadata you will do something like this >
	:ApexRetrieve
< then select CustomObjects line and then run >
	:Expand
< then select Account and run >
	:Retrieve
<
                                                                      *ApexSave*

Similar to :|ApexDeploy| but uses Tooling API instead of Metadata API.
Takes modified files and tries to save them to SFDC.
In some cases (especially in large Orgs) Tooling API may be a bit quicker than
:|ApexDeploy| which uses Metadata API.

Note 1: Uses Tooling API.
Note 2: Deploy with Tooling API does not work in Production Orgs.
Note 3: All commands in :|ApexSave|* family support <bang>, see 
|'g:apex_conflict_check'| for more details.

                                                                   *ApexSaveOne*

Save single file from current buffer.

Note 1: Uses Tooling API.
Note 2: Deploy with Tooling API does not work in Production Orgs.
Note 3: All commands in :|ApexSave|* family support <bang>, see 
|'g:apex_conflict_check'| for more details.
                                                                  *ApexSaveOpen*

Saves files from currently opened tabs or buffers.

Note 1: Uses Tooling API.
Note 2: Deploy with Tooling API does not work in Production Orgs.
Note 3: All commands in :|ApexSave|* family support <bang>, see 
|'g:apex_conflict_check'| for more details.

                                                                   *ApexScratch*

A shortcut to open a scratch file. 
Useful when combined with :|ApexExecuteAnonymous| or :|ApexQuery| commands.

                                                                     *ApexStage*

Stage is a temporary buffer which can be used as a stack to list files/metadata
types which will be used in subsequent Deploy/Remove operations.

Stage content can be manipulated either by commands like :|ApexStageAdd|,
:|ApexStageRemove|, :|ApexStageClear|, :|ApexStageAddOpen| or directly like any
other text buffer.  
Stage is persistent and retains its content between vim editing sessions unless
explicitly cleared. If you use :Write command while in Stage buffer, or just 
switch from Stage to another file/buffer, Stage content will be automatically 
written to a disk file.

See also :|ApexRemoveStaged| and :|ApexDeployStaged|.

                                                                  *ApexStageAdd*

Add current file to |ApexStage|.

                                                              *ApexStageAddOpen*

Cycle through open buffers and add their files to |ApexStage|, provided that
these are supported apex file types.

                                                                *ApexStageClear*

Clear existing stage cache.

                                                               *ApexStageRemove*

Remove file opened in current buffer from stage cache.

                                                                      *ApexTest*

Similar to :|ApexDeploy| but runs unit tests using either Metadata or Tooling
API.
If no class name specified then will run tests in all modified classes that
contain 'testMethod'.

By default no debug log is generated. Default Log level can be configured via
|'g:apex_test_debuggingHeader'| variable.

:|ApexTest| supports command line parameters (and their completion)
Param: 1 - mode: 'meta-testAndDeploy', 'meta-checkOnly', 
                'tooling-sync', 'tooling-async', 'testSuites'
            default: 'testAndDeploy'
           Note: 
            - 'meta-testAndDeploy' runs all test methods in a specified 
              class(es).
            
            - 'meta-checkOnly' 
              - can run all or specific test method(s) in a class(es)
              - does not save modified files to SFDC regardless of test
                outcome.
            
            - 'tooling-sync' and 'tooling-async' use Tooling API and can only
              work with files already saved in remote SFDC. For this reason
              tooling-force.com.jar will try to save modified files (if any)
              before attempting to run the test(s).

            - depending on current SFDC system load you may find that in some
              cases 'tooling-sync' completes faster than 'tooling-async' even
              though 'tooling-async' is advertised in the documentation as
              "allows methods to process in parallel".
            
            - 'tooling-sync' runs all test method(s) in specified class(es).
              Execution is synchronous.

            - 'tooling-async' runs one or more methods within one or more Apex
              classes, using the asynchronous test execution mechanism.
              - can run all or specific test method(s) in a class(es)
            
            - 'testSuites' allows to execute one (or more) Test Suites
              - multiple test suites should be specified comma separated
                e.g. TestSuite1,TestSuite2
              - if you use tab completion then you may have to press it twice
                for Test Suite names parameter - first time calls SFDC to
                query available test suite Names
              - there is no support for creating/managing Test Suite content
                from vim-force.com plugin, use SFDC Developer console instead.  


Param: 2 - class name - use this parameter to run only unit tests in a specific
           class. Multiple test class names can be specified separated by ','.
           In this case 'param 3' has to be '*' or 'param 3' and 'param 4'
           must be omitted. 
           If need to specify particular test method(s) for several classes
           then use following syntax: >
 :ApexTest meta-checkonly TestClass1.method1,TestClass1.method2,TestClass3
<
    Note 1: There are no spaces between class/method names.
           The above command will run 
           - tests method1() and method2() in test class TestClass1
           - all tests in TestClass3

    Note 2: If using wildmenu then command line completion candidates may look
           unusual at first glance - instead of just last method or class name
           string the menu of completions will include full text of Param 2
           entered so far plus new suggestions.

    Note 3: 'meta-checkOnly' does not always return coverage data. This is a
            limitation on SFDC Metadata API side.     
             
Param: 3 - method name - if test class contains several 'testMethod'-s then
           this parameter allows to specify single method to run. Body of all other
           methods will be skipped. This is particularly useful when you want to see log
           file from specific test and do not want other tests to pollute the log.
Param: 4 - target Org/project name. See :|ApexDeploy| for more details

Differences to :|ApexDeploy| 
- if you run :|ApexTest| and get unit tests failure(s) or insufficient overall
  code coverage then SFDC rejects changes and you files are NOT saved in SFDC.

                                                       *ApexTestCoverageHideAll*

Hide test coverage highlight signs in all files.

                                                          *ApexTestCoverageShow*

When last test was run with :|ApexTestWithCoverage| a line-by-line report of
code coverage in the current file can be shown with :|ApexTestCoverageShow|. 
Lines not covered by last unit test run will be highlighted with vim 'sign'
function.
Note: this command accepts command line parameter - name of open buffer.
If provided then coverage will be shown for file open in the specified buffer
instead of current file.

ex 1: with file name (file must be loaded in current or other buffer) >
 :ApexTestCoverageShow MyClass.cls
<
ex 2: without file name (this will attempt to show coverage signs in the current
file) >
 :ApexTestCoverageShow
<
                                                        *ApexTestCoverageToggle*

Shows or hides code coverage highlight for current file.
See :|ApexTestCoverageShow| for more details

                                                          *ApexTestWithCoverage*

Similar to :|ApexTest| but also generates line-by-line report of code coverage
in quickfix buffer.

Coverage signs can be displayed using following methods:

Method 1 - from quickfix buffer
- in your .vimrc set g:apex_quickfix_coverage_toggle_shortcut to a desired key
  e.g. >
  let g:apex_quickfix_coverage_toggle_shortcut = "c"
<
  using mapping in the above example - when you press "c" on a coverage line
  (in quickfix buffer) two things will happen:
  a. as usual you will be taken to the buffer under cursor 
  b. :|ApexTestCoverageToggle| will be immediately executed on that file

Method 2 - using :|ApexTestCoverageShow| or :|ApexTestCoverageToggle| command
           manually without file name
ex: >
 :ApexTestWithCoverage checkOnly MyTestClass
    " open the file where you want to see coverage signs
 :ApexTestCoverageShow
<

Method 3 - using :|ApexTestCoverageShow| or :|ApexTestCoverageToggle| command
           manually with file name
ex: >
 :ApexTestWithCoverage checkOnly MyTestClass
    " before executing next line make sure that buffer with 'OtherClass.cls' is loaded
    " it does not have to be current buffer, but *must* be loaded
 :ApexTestCoverageShow OtherClass.cls
<

Note_1: :|ApexTestWithCoverage| allows to pipe :|ApexTestCoverageShow| command
ex: >
 :ApexTestWithCoverage checkOnly MyTestClass | ApexTestCoverageShow OtherClass.cls
<
Note_2: piping is a bit tempremental, so if it does not work then use the
generic (two commands, each on its own line) version shown above.

                                                               *ApexTListToggle*

Helper for 'TagList' plugin (http://vim-taglist.sourceforge.net)
Taglist plugin does not support mixed filetypes like: apexcode.java 
so we have to trick it like if &filetype was = 'apexcode'
i.e. every time when Taglist is called set filetype=apexcode temporarely
and then revert back to what it was 
See apexcode.vim s:Apex_TList_Toggle() method for more details.

                                                            *ApexToolingVersion*

Return version of tooling-force.com.jar .



==============================================================================
                                                                *auto-complete*
                                                         *apex-code-completion*
Current version includes basic auto completion support for Apex classes and
some standard Apex library namespaces.

Current limitations:
- works best in |server-mode|. 
  In non-server mode you have to wait for tooling-force.com.jar to load every time.
- does not support completion of SObject fields inside SOQL statements
  
Usage:
- configure |server-mode| and try following in .cls file (do not type single quote characters)
    'System.' Ctrl-X,Ctrl-O
	'String str = "abc"; str.' Ctrl-X,Ctrl-O

Recommended .vimrc config for apex completion:
1. shortcut key
    You may want to map Ctrl-X,Ctrl-O to something shorter, e.g. >
	""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
	" map omni completion to Control + Space
	""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
	inoremap <C-Space> <C-x><C-o>
	inoremap <C-@> <C-Space>
<
2. completion menu popup >
    set completeopt=menu,preview,longest
<
  
                                        *resources_unpacked* *zipped-resources*
Work with zipped content of "staticresources/*.resource" files is done as
follows:
- open any class/page/trigger in Vim as normal to let Vim load vim-force.com
  plugin
- navigate to .resource file and open it as you would open normal file in vim
- if selected .resource file is a valid ZIP archive then vim-force.com will
  extract content of .resource file in a separate folder and will open
  directory listing for that folder so you can select relevant file from
  archive to work with
- now you can modify unpacked files from the .resource you have just "opened"
  Every time you save such unpacked file - the corresponding .resource will be
  updated and changes re-packed
- deployment of such modified .resource files is done same way as with any
  other Apex file, using commands like :|ApexDeploy|, :|ApexSave|, etc.

Note: current version of vim-force.com does not support creating new .resource
files. Use SFDC UI to create new static resource and then call
:|ApexRefreshProject|.

==============================================================================

Plugin is using unix utilities 'tee' and 'touch'
On MS Windows these commands are not available out of the box.
UnixUtils for Win32 can be found here: http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/

See |'g:apex_binary_tee'| and |'g:apex_binary_touch'|
On Unix setting these variables is not strictly necessary, unless 'tee' and 'touch'
are not available via $PATH

Plugin also uses other built in shell commands like
'rm', 'mkdir', 'cp' on unix
and
'rmdir', 'copy' on ms windows
But it is assumed that these are generally available out of the box.
If you are using non standard environment then you can define paths to those commands.
See apexOs.vim for details

                                                           *'g:apex_binary_tee'*

	let g:apex_binary_touch = "d:\\bin\\UnixUtils\\touch.exe"
<
                                                             *'g:apex_diff_cmd'*
/path/to/file/compare/tool
ex: >
	let g:apex_diff_cmd="/usr/bin/meld"
<
If undefined then internal vimdiff will be used

                                                            *'g:apex_ctags_cmd'*
/path/to/exuberant/ctags/binary
ex: >
	let g:apex_ctags_cmd="/usr/local/bin/ctags"
<
If undefined then first available ctags binary will be used for tag generation

                                                *'g:apex_syntax_case_sensitive'*
Use this variable to specify that Apex classes and triggers shall use case sensitive
syntax highlighting.
If not specified then Apex default is used - ignore case
ex: >
	let g:apex_syntax_case_sensitive = 1 " make syntax highlighting case sensitive
<

                                                          *'g:apex_API_version'*
Optional.
When commands like |ApexNewFile| generate new *-meta.xml file the 
<apiVersion>25.0</apiVersion> value is taken from 'g:apex_API_version' variable.
Set this variable to the necessary value if default does not meet your needs.
ex: >
	let g:apex_API_version="25.0"
<

                                                       *'g:apex_pollWaitMillis'*
Optional. 
Defaults to 1000. Sets pollWaitMillis for tooling-force.com.jar tasks. 
Number of milliseconds to wait between each poll of Salesforce to retrieve the
results. The smaller the value defined by 'g:apex_pollWaitMillis' the quicker
deploy will finish, but on slow connections larger values, like 10000 may be
necessary.
See ant-salesforce.jar documentation for 'pollWaitMillis' parameter.

                                                      *'g:apex_maxPollRequests'*
Optional. 
Defaults to 1000. Sets maxPollRequests for tooling jar tasks. 
The number of times to poll Salesforce for the results of the task.
Usually default value is sufficient, but if you have a large Org and
|'g:apex_pollWaitMillis'| parameter is short then higher
'g:apex_maxPollRequests' value may be needed.

                                                         *'g:apex_test_debuggingHeader'*
Optional. 
Logging levels to use for tests. Defaults to no logs.
See Metadata API documentation for 'DebuggingHeader'.
ex:  >
    let g:apex_test_debuggingHeader = {"All": "Error", "Visualforce": "Error",
    \ "Workflow": "Error", "Db": "Error", "System": "Error", "Callout": "Error",
    \ "Apex_profiling": "Error", "Apex_code": "Debug", "Validation": "Error"}
<

                                                *'g:apex_conflict_check'*
Optional.
By default every time when |:ApexDeploy| or |:ApexTest| command is issued a
check is done if there have been changes to remote (SFDC) version of local
files which are currently being deployed. 
In order to control this behaviour 'g:apex_conflict_check' variable can be
set as follows:
- To disable check  - set to 0
- any other value means - "check always".
ex: >

	let g:apex_conflict_check = 1 " always check
	let g:apex_conflict_check = 0 " never check
<
Note: If you want to disable conflict check for a single :|ApexDeploy| or 
:|ApexTest| operation then use <bang>, ex: >
	:ApexDeploy!
<
                                                             *'g:apex_java_cmd'*
Optional.
If java executable is not found in $PATH then specify custom location like so >
 " windows
 let g:apex_java_cmd = 'c:\\path\\to\\your\\java.exe'
 " *nix
 let g:apex_java_cmd = '/path/to/your/java'
<

                                           *'g:apex_tooling_force_dot_com_path'*
Full path to toolling-force.com.jar.
toolling-force.com.jar can be obtained on 'releases' page here: 
https://github.com/neowit/tooling-force.com
>
 " windows
 let g:apex_tooling_force_dot_com_path = 'c:\\path\\to\\folder\\toolling-force.com.jar'
 " *nix
 let g:apex_tooling_force_dot_com_path = '/path/to/folder/toolling-force.com.jar'
<

                                    *'g:apex_tooling_force_dot_com_java_params'*
Optional.
Allows to pass extra parameters to java virtual machine.
e.g. change default stdout log level to 'info' >
 let g:apex_tooling_force_dot_com_java_params = "-Dorg.apache.commons.logging.simplelog.defaultlog=info"
<

                                   *'g:apex_tooling_force_dot_com_extra_params'*
Optional.
Allows to pass extra parameters to tooling-force.com.jar every time when it is
called.
e.g. set proxy >
 let g:apex_tooling_force_dot_com_extra_params = "--http.proxyHost=localhost --http.proxyPort=8888 --http.proxyUser=some --http.proxyPassword=pass"
<

                                             *'g:zip_zipcmd'* *'g:zip_unzipcmd'*
Optional.
In order to handle zipped *.resource files zip and unzip command line binaries
must be available in $PATH or explicitly specified via 'g:zip_zipcmd' and
'g:zip_unzipcmd' variables.
e.g. >
 let g:zip_zipcmd = "/usr/local/bin/zip"
 let g:zip_unzipcmd = "/usr/local/bin/unzip"
<
see also |zipped-resources|

                                                    *'g:apex_OnCommandComplete'*
Optional.
Can be used to execute a shell command upon completion of long running
Apex command.
'g:apex_OnCommandComplete' is a dictionary which accepts two values:
- script: full command line
- timeoutSec: how long command needs to run for script to be executed

Example 1: (OSX, MacVim) >
    let g:apex_OnCommandComplete = {'script': 'osascript -e "tell application \"MacVim\" to activate"', 'timeoutSec': 10}
<
if Apex command (e.g. :|ApexTest|) runs for more than 10 seconds then upon
completion MacVim window will be brought back to focus. May be useful if you
want to switch to another application while vim is working, but want to go back
to vim as soon as command execution is done.

Example 2: (OSX) if you want to announce completion of long running :|ApexDeploy|
then g:apex_OnCommandComplete can be configured like so: >
   let g:apex_OnCommandComplete = {'script': 'say "Job finished"', 'timeoutSec': 10}  
<
if command runs for more than 10 seconds then upon completion you will hear
"Job finished" from computer speaker.


                                                       *'g:apex_workspace_path'*
Optional.
root folder to use when creating new project with :|ApexInitProject|

                                        *server-mode* *server* *'g:apex_server'*
                                        *g:apex_server_timeoutSec*
                                        *g:apex_server_port*
Optional.
Use |'g:apex_server'| to enable/disable server mode.
Warning: server mode uses substantial amount of RAM and is not suitable for
underpowered machines.

In order to use Server mode you either have to be on *nix system which has
'echo' and 'nc'(netcat) commands, or have your vim instance compiled with
|+python| or |+python/dyn|. See |vim-python-ms-windows|.

In the old (non server) mode tooling-force.com.jar binary is loaded into memory
every time when it is needed, e.g. every time when apex class is saved to SFDC.
This allows to minimise RAM usage but makes every operation slower by the
number of seconds required to read from disk and load tooling-force.com.jar
binary.  Some operations (e.g. auto-completion) may not be practical in non
server mode due to the time it takes for operation to complete.

Server mode allows to keep tooling-force.com binary in RAM after it was first
loaded, as well as cache some data in RAM, so all subsequent operations use
already loaded tooling-force.com.jar instance which may noticeably reduce the
time taken by every operation involving tooling-force.com.jar binary.

Once loaded tooling-force.com.jar will keep itself loaded until
|'g:apex_server_timeoutSec'| timeout since last touch is reached.
For example if g:apex_server_timeoutSec is set to 1800 seconds then tooling-force.com.jar
will unload itself from memory when 30 minutes elapse since last time
vim-force.com called it.

Use |'g:apex_server_timeoutSec'| to set the timeout and minimise RAM usage when
you are not working with vim-force.com plugin.
e.g. >
	let g:apex_server=1 " start server on first call
	" allow server to wait for new connections within 30 minutes
	let g:apex_server_timeoutSec=60*30
<

Server is accessed via a TCP socket on port 8888. If you want to change the
port then define |'g:apex_server_port'| global variable in your .vimrc, e.g. >
	let g:apex_server_port = 65000
<

MS Windows: when executing first command and tooling-force.com server
is not yet running you will see a new DOS/CMD window popup. Do NOT close it,
just minimise and leave it running.

                                                        *vim-python-ms-windows*
In order to eliminate CMD.exe window popups on MS Windows current version of
vim-force.com plugin (when run in |server-mode|) takes advantage of python
support in vim.
To check if your vim supports python run following in vim: >
	:echo has("python")
<line above must respond: 1 
if it does then make further check: >
	:python print 'hello'
<
If you get 'hello' in response (no quotes) and no error messages then you are
good to go. If not then use your favourite search engine to find out how to
install vim with python support and also check: >
	:help python 
	:help python-dynamic
<

LIMITATIONS                                             *force.com-limitations*

Salesforce Metadata API does not (in most cases) report error line numbers
in Visualforce pages making it impossible to go-to actual problem line if
compile/save fails due to syntax error. This is similar to Force.com IDE for
Eclipse.

On MS Windows default configuration spawns separate DOS/CMD window on every call
to command line utility.
There are two ways to mitigate this:
1. install vimproc: https://github.com/Shougo/vimproc.vim
OR
2. use |server-mode|

==============================================================================
RECOMMENDED-PLUGINS                             *force.com-recommended-plugins*
